# UnixCommandsInC

This project is a learning journey into the heart of Unix.
I’m rebuilding some of the most popular and essential Unix/Linux commands from scratch in C to understand how they work under the hood.

The goal is to:

Learn systems programming concepts (file I/O, processes, permissions, etc.)

Explore how simple building blocks form the foundation of an operating system

Provide small, readable, stand-alone implementations of classic tools like cat, ls, cp, mv, grep, and more

### Example Commands Planned
- `cat` — concatenate and print files  
- `ls` — list directory contents  
- `cp` — copy files  
- `mv` — move/rename files  
- `grep` — search for patterns  
- `echo` — print arguments to stdout  
…and more to come.
